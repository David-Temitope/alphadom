**Learning:** Combining algorithmic efficiency ($O(N)$ lookups), component memoization, and route-based code splitting provides a holistic performance boost. While each is "small", their cumulative effect on First Contentful Paint (FCP) and interaction latency is significant.
**Action:** Always check for nested `.find()` or `.filter()` calls in data mapping hooks, especially those used in large lists. Use `Map` for constant-time lookups. Pair this with `React.memo` for list items and `React.lazy` for routes to ensure the app stays fast as it grows.
